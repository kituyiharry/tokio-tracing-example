// So, that program behaves just like its sync counterpart, 
// as in: it only handles one connection at a time. 
// If client A connects, client B won't be able to connect until client A 
// closes its connection (or has its connection closed by the server):

// But unlike the sync version of our code, 
// it's not blocked on the read syscall. 
// It's, again, blocked on epoll_wait
//
// So next is to logically spawn threads that can epoll_wait for non-blocking io
